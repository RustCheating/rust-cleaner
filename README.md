# EAC/Rust Cleaner

Simple batch file that cleans traces of gamebans on steam / easyanticheat folders.
Make sure to run this every time you need your traces cleaned / if you got 3day banned or perma banned.

Make sure you're running as administrator
---
If you don't run as admin certain traces won't be cleaned such as regedit and privileged files. (Might get you banned again)
